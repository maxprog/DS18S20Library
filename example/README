The library is distributed with the following examples:
- DS18B20example1.c;
- DS18B20example2.c;
- DS18B20example3.c;
- DS18S20example1.c.


They are tested on Atmega32 microcontroller.

DS18B20example1, DS18B20example2 and DS18S20example1 use serial port for representing sensor readings to the user.
The code for serial communication is implemented in UART.c and UART.h files. DS18B20example3 displays the temperature
reading on LCD module. It uses HD44780library (https://github.com/positronic57/HD44780Library) for driving the LCD module.


DS18B20example1.c

This program demonstrates the usage of DS18S20 library with Atmega32 for temperature measurement. 
The temperature reading from the sensor is first converted to a decimal value using DS18x20_TemperatureValue() function from the library and 
then to a string by dtostrf().This function is located in the mathematical library, libm.a. Link this example with the math library using 
the -lm switch while compiling.

DS18B20example2.c

This example demonstrates how DS18S20 library can be use for reading DS18B20 ROM code and check the power supply type of the sensor. 


DS18S20example3.c

The temperature reading from the sensor in this example is displayed on the connected LCD module. HD44780library is used for LCD support.

DS18S20example1.c

This program demonstrates the usage of DS18S20 library with Atmega32 for temperature measurement. 
The temperature reading from DS18S20 sensor is converted to a string with additional function 
that is not part of the library and send via serial port.

The library is distributed with the following examples:
- DS18B20example1.c;
- DS18B20example2.c;
- DS18S20example1.c.

They are tested on Atmega32 microcontroller.

All of them use serial port for representing sensor readings to the user.
The code for serial communication is implemented in UART.c and UART.h files.

DS18B20example1.c

This program demonstrates the usage of DS18S20 library with Atmega32 for temperature measurement. 
The temperature reading from the sensor is first converted to a decimal value using DS18x20_TemperatureValue() function from the library and then to a string by dtostrf(). 
This function is located in the mathematical library, libm.a. 
Link this example with the math library with the -lm option while compiling.

DS18B20example2.c

This example demonstrates how DS18S20 library can be use for reading DS18B20 ROM code and check the power supply type of the sensor. 

DS18S20example1.c

This program demonstrates the usage of DS18S20 library with Atmega32 for temperature measurement. 
The temperature reading from DS18S20 sensor is converted to a string with additional function 
that is not part of the library and send via serial port.

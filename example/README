This example demonstrates the usage of DS18S20 library on Atmega32 microcotroller.
The temperature sensor is connected on the PIN defined in the config.h header.

The program starts with the initialization sequence on the 1-Wire bus.
If the DS18S20 responds to the init signal, the microcontroller reads the
ROM of DS18S20 and sends the serial number of the sensor via serial port
in hexadecimal format.

After that the microcontroller sends a command that initiates a temperature conversion.
The temperature value is stored in 2 registers in the DS18S20 scratchpad.
Atmega32 reads the content of the scratchpad using ReadDS18S20ScratchPad function
and sends the value of the temperature registers on the serial port.
The temperature can be then calculated as explained in the DS18S20 data sheet.

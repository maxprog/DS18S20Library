There are two schemata distributed with the library as a part of the example section:
- DS18B20example3.sch demonstrates temperature measurement with DS18B20 sensor using DS18S20Library and Atmega32 microcontroller. The sensor reading is presented on LCD module driven by HD44780.
- DS18B20exampleSerial.sch demonstrates another example where the temperature reading is available via serial port.

The software for DS18B20examples3.sch is listed in DS18B20Example3.c source file.

DS18B20exampleSerial.sch covers the following examples: DS18B20example1.c, DS18B20example2.c and DS18S20example1.c.

The circuits are created with Eagle 7.3.0.

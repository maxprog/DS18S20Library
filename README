DS18S20 temperature sensor AVR-libc library for AVR 8-bit microcontrollers.

The library contains two parts. One for implementation of 1-Wire interface and the second
for communication with the DS18S20 temperature sensor over 1-Wire interface.

Config.h header is used to define the microcontroller PINs for connection with the sensor.

Tested on Atmel Atmega32 microcontroller.

Usage

The following functions are included in the library:

 - void SendCommand2DS18S20(uint8_t)
	The function is used to send function commands to DS18S20. The command is specified as argument to the function.
	The list of supported commands is defined in ds18s20.h header file.
 - uint8_t Send_READ_ROM_Command2DS18S20(uint8_t *)
	The function sends READ_SCRATCHPAD command to the sensor. The sensor response is return via the function argument.
	It returns 1 in case of successful attempt to read the ROM, 0 in case of failure. 

 - void StartConvertTemperature()	
	Send CONVERT_T command to the sensor so it can start with the temperature measurement and wait till the
	conversion is over.

 - uint8_t ReadDS18S20ScratchPad(uint8_t *)
	Read sensors internal memory and check the integrity of the data with CRC. 
	Returns 1 if the integrity check is successful, 0 if there is a CRC error.

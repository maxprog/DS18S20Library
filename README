DS18S20library is an AVR C library for connecting DS18S20 and DS18B20 temperature sensors to 8-bit AVR microcontrollers.
The library implements 1-Wire interface for communication with DS18S20/DS18B20.
Originally it was written for DS18S20 and starting from version 0.4 the library fully supports
DS18B20 sensor model as well.

What's New

Version 0.5
- The library detect the sensor model during the initialization process. There is no need to specify sensor model in the init function as before; 
- The examples are updated with the new init function that can detect the sensor model.

Supported MCU Hardware

The library is compatible with every 8-bit AVR microcontroller.

DS1820 support and implemented functions

The following sensor models are supported by the library:
- DS18S20;
- DS18B20.

The library can be used only in cases when DS18x20 sensor is powered by external power supply.
Although the library includes a function that can determine the power supply type, this information is not taken in 
consideration when the library communicates with the sensor via the 1-Wire bus.

Current version supports 1-Wire bus with only one device attached to it.
SEARCH_ROM is not implemented in the library so it cannot query the bus for connected devices/sensors.

Implemented DS18x20 ROM Commands:
- DS18S20/DS18B20 sensor initialization;
- READ ROM command for fetching the ROM address of the sensor;
- SKIP ROM command so the library can speak to the sensor directly without using sensors 1-Wire bus address.

Implemented DS18x20 Function Commands:
- Convert T command that initiates a single temperature conversion;
- READ SCRATCHPAD command that allows the master to read the contents of the sensor memory;
- READ POWER SUPPLY command to determine power supply type of DS18S20/DS18B20;
- WRITE SCRATCHPAD command that allows the master to write 2 bytes of data to the scratchpad of DS18S20/DS18B20;
- COPY SCRATCHPAD command that copies the contents of the scratchpad TH and TL registers (bytes 2 and 3) to EEPROM;
- RECALL E2 recalls the alarm trigger values (TH and TL) from EEPROM of the sensor.

Usage

The library use DS18x20_Init function to define the 1-Wire bus and initialize the sensor. The function detects the sensor
model (DS18B20 or DS18S20) during the initialization process.
For bus definition, the init function requires two arguments:
- the address of MCU PORT used for 1-Wire bus;
- MCU pin that is connected to the DQ pin of DS18S20/DS18B20.

For example:

DS18x20_Init(pDS18S20,&PORTD,PD5);

The first argument is a pointer to the structure that represents the sensor. See the documentation section for further details.

After the initialization step, the rest of the library functions/macros can be used to
get the address of the sensor, start a temperature conversion and read the sensor memory that contains 
the temperature value.

Check the doc folder for detailed describtion of the library.

Tested on Atmega32 and Atiny2313 microcontrollers.

DS18S20 temperature sensor AVR-libc library for AVR 8-bit microcontrollers.
The library contains two parts. One for implementation of 1-Wire interface and the second
for communication with the DS18S20 temperature sensor over 1-Wire interface.
Config.h header is used to define the microcontroller PINs for connection with the sensor.
Tested on Atmel Atmega32 microcontroller.
